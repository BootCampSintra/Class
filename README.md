## Welcome to BootCamp Sintra

You can use the [video ] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PlsofEgCCxk)  to visualize the best project of life.

Well, I can not say bad about this class, because it's the best class anyone could have.
Although our behaviors are not the best, we are a very close-knit group which makes it a great group, because in spite of everything we support each other.
This year is a last one where we will all be together, it will be very difficult, to separate us, we are already so used to each other, for me this group is a great family.
